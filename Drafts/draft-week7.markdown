Work slowed down a bit because I have been onholiday, so this blog covers from around the 13th of June to the 05th of July.

I have almost finished a whole twitter-like social app in the MEAN stack.  I need to finish it off with a few things like remembering users and testing.

I have also completed the small twitter listing app, some Three JS projects and some more 2d canvas apps to keep my hand in on the front end side of things.

Next i would like to work on finishing the parallax site I began but didn't finish before my holiday, and then work on
