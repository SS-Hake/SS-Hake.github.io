My name is Sam Scott-Hake, I am currently working towards an MSc Computer Science by Research from the University of Lincoln.  On this website you will find some of my side projects as well as a blog which will feature thoughts from my work and leisure coding projects! 

You can find the source code for this site as well as the code for the javascript projects linked here on my [github!](https://github.com/SS-Hake)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
