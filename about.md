My name is Sam Scott-Hake, I am currently a graduate student at the University of Lincoln.  This is my personal blog, where among other things, 
I keep a record of my progress in learning different aspects of web design.

###Long-term goals

Some advice I have absorbed along the way, which I think was valuable, was to always have a goal, or set of goals, at any given time.  The goals can be changed over time, you can change direction completely if you need to, but the process of zeroing in on an area that interests you and choosing a specific goal to accomplish within it is important.  You can break down the path to completing the goal into small pieces, and complete a small part every day, then even if your goal changes after a week, a month or a year, you still have something tangible to show for the time you have spent working.

Currently my main goal is to complete my MSc with a passing grade, hopefully with a view to publish the results of my research.  

Once this is complete, however, I would like to apply for jobs in web development, so I have begun working with web technologies in my spare time to create a portfolio of web projects which will hopefully be seen my prospective employers.    

Perhaps my goals will have changed in a few months and I will look for jobs in another area, (unlikely because I am really enjoying web-dev so far) but in that case I will have this site to show that I have been working every day for however many weeks as I finish off and write up my MSc.

###Why blog?

In the early part of 2015 I saw a [video][1] of a talk given by Leslie Lamport, who is the creator of LaTeX among other things, which convinced me I should
keep a better record of the progress I am making with regard to my programming skills.  I had been thinking about starting a blog since I completed my BSc,
I had leared an enormous amount reading other people's blogs, checking for new posts linked through hacker news has long been part of my daily ritual.

I had also been tempted because I know many others who have successfully increased their productivity through keeping organised logs of daily or weekly tasks.  I own I very a <i>very </i>  well used 2 meter white board, but apart from that I had never written much outside of the usual planning steps I had developed at university.

All this reading and advice from friends reached critical mass around the beginning of March, so I began keeping a much 
more detailed log of everything I was doing.  The writing I have published since isn't perfect, I haven't taken the time to spell check outside of sublime text, and I am certain the sentence structure has been awful in at least a few places.  However, I have already expedited my learning by a large factor just through keeping these basic notes somewhere accessible.  I no longer have to spend time trying to remember where I got to in a tutorial or which goals I had set last month, I don't have to take any steps backwards while learning.

I intend to keep it up for the forseeable future and would reccomend the blogging process to anyone starting to learn... anything really, I don't think 
the benefits are unique to coding.  I am planning to expand the subject of my posts from the normal weekly roundup/goals into more specific coding 
subjects as well as some tutorials in the future, as much to consolidate my learning as to help anyone else, although I hope they do!
