<p>Welcome to the new Hake Blog!</p>

<p>I’ve finally upgraded to a content management system; Jekyll.  I had been looking at other CMSs for a while but none of them seemed that applicable to a site of this size and structure.  I have used Ruby on Rails and Wordpress before, but they seemed too bukly for use on this site.</p>

<p>I chose Jekyll for a number of reasons including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extreme simplicity; the clean syntax and Angular-esque loops</li>
  <li>No database, which means faster loading</li>
  <li>Simple markdown syntax for content</li>
  <li>Compatibility with Github Hosting</li>
</ul>

<p>Jekyll essentially generates the same static pages that I was writing, but increases writing speed by building the pages from pre-written code modules. This all comes without the need for dynamic hosting, which is a requirement for Wordpress and the like.  Plus, there is always the option to extend with Disqus or a new theme in the future if I do want to add some interactivity or change the look of the site completely.</p>

<p>Over the next 24 hours I’ll set up a custom theme for the site and import my old projects and blog posts.  Once this time is invested, adding new content should become very easy indeed!</p>
