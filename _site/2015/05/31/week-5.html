<p>A belated blog post this week, it took me until now to finish the MEAN stack tutorial I had been using.  My coding experience has taught me not to expect to do anything correctly the first time, so I have just soldiered through the errors and issues I was stuck on throughout the creation of my first app.</p>

<p>I began the week with a few more jQuery canvas apps to keep my hand in, before moving on to the creation of a “Hacker News” clone with persistent data and full functioning comments/upvote system.  I’ve learned the basics of node routing as well as putting what I had learned about linking APIs to Angular applications with services into practice.</p>

<p>Due to the time extension for the completing “<a href="https://github.com/SS-Hake/Seenit">Seenit</a>”, I have pushed one goal from last week, creating a simple AJAx app with functiong back-end, to next week. It’ll be my first task and should only take a couple of hours, if that.</p>

<p>Next week I also plan to create another responsive site from a PSD document.  I have found quite a nice site which provides detailed photoshop documents, which I can open with GIMP, called <a href="http://designscrazed.org/free-photoshop-psd-website-templates/">Designscrazed</a>.   I want to make quite a few of these over the next month or so because I have heard that this will be the sort of thing I will be doing as a junior web developer.  It will mean I can practice more SASS usage, I need to focus on creating a more efficient workspace, complete with proper mixin usage.</p>

<p>My third and final task this week is to create and style the frontend for a store angular appliation, this will combine two areas of research, SASS usage, and Angular app creation.  Most of the Angular applications I have seen so far just use bootstrap, I presume for speed’s sake, but I would like to hand style one just to solidify my learning so far.</p>

<h2 id="next-weeks-goals">Next Week’s Goals</h2>
<p>Finish and host the Seenit news app from last week, and move on to a simple AJAX application for practice’s sake.  Create one, possibly two responsive websites from PSD documents.  Consolidate learning with a hand styled angular store app.</p>
