<p>This week I learned that writing up an MSc thesis is lot harder than I thought it would be; I spend 99% of my time reading papers I read 12 months 
earlier, 0.5% of my time writing, and 0.5% of my time re-writing the little I have written.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot about web tech in my spare time though, so I do at least I have a fair bit to write about on the blog this week.</p>

<p>My first task this week was to finish up and host the Jekyll one page app I started last week.  More information about that task can be found in my previous <a href="/week-3.1">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly I took a plunge into AngularJS by finishing off the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">shaping up with Angular</a> tutorial I had started previously.  The Angular tutorial was fantastic, it took around three hours to complete, and I would heartily reccomend it to anyone starting Angular.  It covers what seems to be all of the basics, starting with a simple module interacting with the HTML using directives, before guiding you through the creation of a fully modularised store
application that utilises dependecy injections and handling information from an HTTP API.</p>

<p>Later in the week I created a quick jQuery app just to keep my hand in with selectors, I also covered some new ground, using new HTML tags as well as caching tag searches to improve efficiency.</p>

<p>I’ve also spent a lot of time researching the next technology I want to tackle; node js.  I’ve established a few tutorials I think will teach me everything I need to know and I am now ready to start coding as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="next-weeks-goals">Next week’s goals:</h2>

<p>I want to get to grips with node js, my end goal is to create a coffee shop or restaurant order Angular app, which will POST or GET orders from a
very simple node API.  From what I’ve read this will involved utilising node, express and probably grunt to create a small server to store the 
information in what I expect will be a postgreSQL database (I presume this because I may eventually host it on Heroku, which I have used before, 
but hosting is not a priority).</p>
