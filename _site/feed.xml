        <title>Week 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week centred around the creation of a few more jQuery apps, testing out Angular with a simple one page app, and the prototype of a small javascript library I would like to publish named Twilight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started the week with three more slightly more complex canvas apps, which incorporated collisions and some more complex maths.  This is nothing I haven’t dealt with before, but I feel like the correct pacing while learning Javascript/jQuery will make me aware of more of their intricacies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ss-hake.github.io/pages/particlesTest.html&quot;&gt;Particles.js&lt;/a&gt; library, which really opened my eyes to how easy it was to create a useful and interesting library with javascript, so I began work on my own this week. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ss-hake.github.io/pages/twilight.html&quot;&gt;Twilight.js&lt;/a&gt; is still in the early stages but I have created the basis for an active background which simulates a warm summers evening (inspired by the evening of the 19th April 2015) using a canvas element.  The background features randomly generated twinkling stars and planets of various sizes, as well as randomly generated, animated planes and satellites which move accross the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on Twilight.js towards the end of the week I also completed my goals from last week’s post by testing AngularJS with a simple app which displays different information through interaction with different HTML elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals for next week are to add random shooting stars to Twilight.js as well as adding support for an initialisation file which sets different variables such as plane and satellite frequency and the background colour of the canvas.  Once that is complete, some final tweaking is all that will be required before publication of my first Javascript library on Github!  Once that is complete I will be able to focus more on my AngularJS development and start looking at methods to incorporate persistent data into my apps, allowing for the development of more useful apps like shopping lists, etc!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First published: 18/04/15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s the end of my first week.  I wanted to spend this week getting used to web development again, creating a few apps which just selected some elements and did something with them. The most basic concept of jQuery is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/&quot;&gt;“select some elements and do something with them”&lt;/a&gt;, so jQuery seemed like a good starting point!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made 6 apps so far, I started with a very simple script which handled the cursor entering a large selection of square divs I had created manually by copy-pasting HTML elements.  I ended the week with an app which uses a wrapper library on top of jQuery to automate the generation and animation of 1000 divs, I’m quite happy with that progression.  Along the way, I’ve been re-learning the basic concepts of Javascript and learning a lot more about jQuery, as well as little tips and tricks I hadn’t heard before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these tips was to use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to host my Javascript libraries. I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/&quot;&gt;this interesting post&lt;/a&gt; which extolled the virtues of letting &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/&quot;&gt;Google host your libraries for you&lt;/a&gt;.  Adding the little tag pointing to the hosts library, rather than a copy I am hosting, results in faster loading times, cross-site caching and when I get around to using them; benefits when using AJAX calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other tips and tricks cropped up as I was reading through the jQuery documentation. Things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://learn.jquery.com/performance/append-outside-loop/&quot;&gt;appending outside of loops&lt;/a&gt; to increase performance and reduce computationally costly DOM insertion.  Or, using #ID and element selectors where ever possible, due to the fact that they are based on native DOM operations, which reduce search space that using attribute or pseudo might entail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next week I plan to expand my usage of underscore and put out some more complex jQuery apps.  I’ve also found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/&quot;&gt;cool library&lt;/a&gt; for making particles I’d like to try out, so one of the week’s apps will probably involve that (although I will be forced to host it myself!).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hake Blog v2.0</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new Hake Blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve finally upgraded to a content management system; Jekyll.  I had been looking at other CMSs for a while but none of them seemed that applicable to a site of this size and structure.  I have used Ruby on Rails and Wordpress before, but they seemed too bukly for use on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Jekyll for a number of reasons including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extreme simplicity; the clean syntax and Angular-esque loops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No database, which means faster loading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple markdown syntax for content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compatibility with Github Hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll essentially generates the same static pages that I was writing, but increases writing speed by building the pages from pre-written code modules. This all comes without the need for dynamic hosting, which is a requirement for Wordpress and the like.  Plus, there is always the option to extend with Disqus or a new theme in the future if I do want to add some interactivity or change the look of the site completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next 24 hours I’ll set up a custom theme for the site and import my old projects and blog posts.  Once this time is invested, adding new content should become very easy indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
