Half the problem with learning to code is unknown unknowns.  You can learn the basics of a technology very quickly, but learning what that technology is really capable of requires a much deeper understanding of the majority of a technologies intricacies, which can take a long time.  The fastest way I have found for doing this is to simply to focus on the volume of projects you create using the technology you are learning.  Focusing on fairly fast project development, over slow, methodical development with attention to detail can benfit you greatly by allowing you to commit the basics to memory incredibly quickly, the sooner you can get the first 20 minutes of project creation underway without stopping to read or look up a basic definition, the sooner you can focus on reading up on the more advanced aspects of a technology or platform.  Then as you learn those


You might understand it all but you will not be able to produce a functioning prototype quickly.  Creating many fast prototypes key to successful coding
key to iterating through ideas until they work
key to producing working apps which can be shipped in fast time.

###TEAS

foraging. free, natural food. often talked about. rarely exploted to it's fullest extent.  perhaps at some point you picked blackberries with your family and made a few jars of jam, or happened accross an apple tree and had a quick snack, but foraging can provide much more than a few snacks in summer

Tea. Free tea. That's just scratching the surface of is what's on offer in the countryside of the UK from August to late September.  James and I ventured in to a meadow near Buntingford, Hertfordshire last week to sample some of the simple delights of British summer teas.


I'll start with the best we sampled; Blackberry.  Brewed by adding the ripest blackberries you can find (usually the central berry in each cluster, the 'terminal' berry) to water and boiling for 2-3 minutes, we both agreed we could drink this sweet, aromatic tea every morning.  While simmering, the berries lose their dark colour to the water and turn a distinctive shade of red when the brewing is complete.  The resulting purple tea tasted just as good as it smelled; like the best store bought fruit tea you have tasted.  With one teaspoon of sugar it became something that I would heartily reccomend as a pick-me-up early morning in the woods, sure to negate the effects of even the worst night in a tent.


We could smell the wild spearmint in the surrounding vegetation before we could see it, once sighted (by way of the distinctive clusters of purple flowers) and harvested, we added around a dozen chopped, large leaves to two mugs worth of boiling water.  After steeping for around 3 minutes, the tea took on a rather unappetising yellow tinge.  Predictably pepperminty and slightly sickly, the taste is more palatable than the smell and appearance, a bit like someone has melted a polo in too much water.  I would reccomend Wild Spearmint as a complimentary additive to other teas rather than the sole component, namely Rosehip.


The tea we were least likely to try again was Hawthorn, this can be brewed using any combination of Hawthorne berries and leaves (we tried all combinations).  While simmering gently, the Hawthorne emits a starchy, almost umami odor, which did not fill us with confidence about the taste.  The final product carries a starchy earl grey flavour and then what I can only describe as a celery, plantmattery, chlorophyll aftertaste, which is odd, but not particularly unpleasant. Frankly, I would prefer to just eat the leaves, which have a texture and taste similar to appleskin, straight off the plant.

All of these teas come with a variety of health benefits, both anecdotal and proven, ranging from lowering blood pressure to potentially lowering the risk of heart disease in the case of rosehip.  They are also all entirely free and quite easy to spot in hedgerows around the countryside from early August to late September and early October.  It is quite easy to pick enough rosehips to last all winter drinking every day from just one waist-high bush, the others, which are harder to store long term provide a nice seasonal treat when rambling or camping.





Generally

Hawthrone

I have always notice hawthorne in hedgerows and ditches, driving or cycling past, it had always looked appetising, but my parents had (sensibly) taught me not to eat any berries I found outdoors as a flat rule.  
###Hydration

Plastic collapsible water bottles are a great idea.  Water is one of those things which people, no matter how dedicated to being ultralight, cannot compress or reduce in volume.  You can dehydrate food, cut off parts of your bag, but you can't make that water any smaller than it is.  Collapsible bottles then at least give you the chance to reduce the volume of what you carry when you have emptied them.

Platypus SoftBottle *TM collapsile hydration system.  A complex name for a simple object, a plastic bag with a sports cap glued on.  These things are anything up to £14 on amazon.co.uk and the cap *alone* is £5.  Perhaps these collapsible bottles are astonishingly durable and warrant the price tag, but I have a feeling I'll be able to snag a comparable experience with a bottle less than one fifth the price on Aliexpress, direct from the chinese factory or wholesaler!

Sadly, one of the bottles I ordered to review arrived with a small tear in either side.  This was a shame, but also provided a chance to test the Aliexpress 

#The selection

The bottles I have ordered range from platypus lookalikes to more novel designs


For those that haven't heard of Aliexpress before, it is a chinese shopping site offering chinese made products direct from 
the wholesaler or factory, before any branding has been added, shipped to you usually for free and usually in 30-90 days.
Generally the products are very cheap, with lacking, but in my experience perfectly servicable quality.  In this series I 
will review a selection of products ordered from Aliexpress, which I think will challenge the value of products from the more
reputable outdoor brands.  I won't be expecting outstanding products which will last a lifetime, but a product that provides
90% of the functionality of a branded alternative, for less than 25% of the price.

Prioritising expenditure

"I don't want my gear to fail on me, so I am happy to pay more."  

This makes some sense to me, there are objects in even my overnight kit which I want to be of high quality, simply because I 
don't want to have repair them or deal with the consequences of a malfunction.  For example my rucksack is a Wisport Sparrow
20L, an army grade rucksack made of Cordura which will stand up to a lot more than the aggressive brambles and hawthrone
which frequent my camping spots.  T bought this rucksack because the fallout from a malfunction, though unlikely, is large
enough to warrant a larger spend.

Having said that, there are many items in my pack which I have either spent way too much on, or could be of lower quality
without effecting my quality of life in camp.  These items are the ones which I would like to prioritise in this series.

Containers, food and water.
Cooking utensils.
Socks


Wisport supply gear to the polish army and use high quality cordura which will withstand a lot more than agressive brambles and hawthorne.  I bought that because I don't want to have to deal with broken straps or buy a whole new bag (and pay for postage) 
even on an overnight trip.  However, there are many items which either don't see that much direct wear and tear or cannot be 
overengineered to the point


 this be the place to buy servicable and cheap alternatives to the western (or possibly just re-branded) competition.



Reviewing products to see if they hold up to the real thing, while being pennies on the dollar.

Honestly I am a little jealous of the people who can afford, or are sponsored by Rab, and use a £500 900 fill down sleeping bag, but I would much rather spend a lot less and be able to go on a great many more trips because of it, I do buy the gear to use it after all!

Therefore the purpose of this blog is to inform those people like me, who would like to prioritise spending on the travel and interesting food around the world, and still experience relative comfort while spending time outdoors.

wanting to dive in is great, but you don't need to spend large sums of money to do that.

I think too many people are put off buying cheap items when assembling camping kit, because they would prefer to buy one item and own it for the rest of their lives if possible, because that would be the best value for money.  But often it isn't, when you're just starting to spend time outdoors is the worst time to invest large sums of money in kit; you don't know what you need and you don't know how to use it.

Head torch example
I bought my first headtorch a year ago, I have since lent and showed it to a range of people who have all been impressed by what it offers and the build quality; 5 modes, night vision mode, USB micro rechargable cable and a nice dry bag carrying bag.  They have, without fail, all raised their eyebrows in suprise when i tell them it was £16.  I knew nothing about head torches, but had heard they were handy when camping, so I scrolled down to the cheapest rechargible one on amazon and found a diamond in the rough.  Even if it had been terrible and only lasted me a few months, I had leared that a headtorch was a complete game changer

You see this all the time with knives
Buying cheap now doesn't mean you can't upgrade down the line.  It doesn't mean this cheap purchase is wasted money, you'll learn a lot from owning and using the cheap item, and will be more able to allocate spending on more expensive versions down the line, once you know what you want.
Expensive camping equipment tends to be specialised, it is made for a specific area or type of outdoor person
















Water bottles

For those of you that haven't heard of or used Aliexpress before, it's essentially chinese amazon, it puts you directly in contact with the chinese factories and wholesalers which produce or supply a vast range of products to the western sellers you usually find on Amazon and Ebay.  There are also some products you can't find anywhere else.
