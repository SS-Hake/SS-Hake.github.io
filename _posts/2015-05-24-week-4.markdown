This week I learned that writing up an MSc thesis is lot harder than I thought it would be; I spend 99% of my time reading papers I read 12 months 
earlier, 0.5% of my time writing, and 0.5% of my time re-writing the little I have written.

I have learned a lot about web tech in my spare time though, so I do at least I have a fair bit to write about on the blog this week.

My first task this week was to finish up and host the Jekyll one page app I started last week.  More information about that task can be found in my previous [blog post][1].
