Welcome to the new Hake Blog!

I've finally upgraded to a content management system; Jekyll.  I had been looking at other CMSs for a while but none of them seemed that applicable to a site of this size and structure.  I have used Ruby on Rails and Wordpress before, but they seemed too bukly for use on this site.  

I chose Jekyll for a number of reasons including:

* Extreme simplicity; the clean syntax and Angular-esque loops
* No database, which means faster loading
* Simple markdown syntax for content
* Compatibility with Github Hosting

Jekyll essentially generates the same static pages that I was writing, but increases writing speed by building the pages from pre-written code modules. This all comes without the need for dynamic hosting, which is a requirement for Wordpress and the like.  Plus, there is always the option to extend with Disqus or a new theme in the future if I do want to add some interactivity or change the look of the site completely.

Over the next 24 hours I'll set up a custom theme for the site and import my old projects and blog posts.  Once this time is invested, adding new content should become very easy indeed!
