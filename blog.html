				<h4>Week 1</h4>	
				<h6>18/04/15</h6>
				<p>
					So, it's the end of my first week.  I wanted to spend this week getting used to
					web development again, creating a few apps which just selected some elements and did something 
					with them. The most basic concept of jQuery is to <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/"> "select some elements and do something with them"</a>,   
					so jQuery seemed like a good starting point!
				<p>
					I've made 6 apps so far, I started with a very simple script which handled the cursor entering a 
					large selection of square divs I had created manually by copy-pasting HTML elements.  I ended the 
					week with an app which uses a wrapper library on top of jQuery to automate the generation and animation 
					of 1000 divs, I'm quite happy with that progression.  Along the way, I've been re-learning the basic 
					concepts of Javascript and learning a lot more about jQuery, as well as little tips and tricks I hadn't heard
					before.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first of these tips was to use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to host my Javascript libraries.
					I found <a href="http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/"
					>this interesting post</a> which extolled the virtues of letting <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">Google host your libraries for you</a>.  Adding the little tag pointing to the host's
					library, rather than a copy I am hosting, results in faster loading times, cross-site caching and when I get
					around to using them; benefits when using AJAX calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other tips and tricks cropped up as I was reading through the jQuery documentation. Things like <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/performance/append-outside-loop/">appending outside of loops</a> to increase performance 
					and reduce computationally costly DOM insertion.  Or, using #ID and element selectors where ever 
					possible, due to the fact that they are based on native DOM operations, which reduce search space that using 
					attribute or pseudo might entail.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the next week I plan to expand my usage of underscore and put out some more complex jQuery apps.  I've also found a <a href="https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/">
					cool library</a> for making particles I'd like to try out, so one of the week's apps will probably involve 
					that (although I will be forced to host it myself!).
